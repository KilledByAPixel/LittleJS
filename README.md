# ![LittleJS Logo](examples/favicon.png) LittleJS - The Tiny JavaScript Game Engine That Can

## All aboard!


LittleJS is a super lightweight JavaScript game engine designed for modern web development. With its fast hybrid rendering system, it offers a comprehensive suite of game development tools from rendering to sound effects. The code is very clean and well documented with a variety of examples to get you started. Choo-Choo! ðŸš‚

## How to use LittleJS

To use LittleJS download the latest package from GitHub or call ```npm install littlejsengine```. This package contains the engine and several small examples.

[You can use the empty example template as a starting point.](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/examples/empty/game.js) This file contains just the minimal setup to start the engine. You can also download and include [littlejs.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/build/littlejs.js) or [littlejs.min.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/build/littlejs.min.js).

If your game loads any files like images you will need to run a local web server. I recommend an editor that does this automatically like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Live Server plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). You can also use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) via npm.

## Tutorial

- [Breakout Tutorial](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/examples/breakoutTutorial) - Shows how to make a simple game from scatch with LittleJS.

## Builds

To easily include LittleJS in your game, you can use one of the 3 pre-built js files. These are also built automatically by the build scripts.

- [littlejs.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/build/littlejs.js) - The full game engine with debug mode available
- [littlejs.release.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/build/littlejs.release.js) - The engine optimized for release builds
- [littlejs.min.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/build/littlejs.min.js) - The engine in release mode and minified

LittleJS can also be imported as a module. There are two module flavors that are automatically built.

- [littlejs.esm.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/build/littlejs.esm.js) - The engine exported as a module with debug mode available
- [littlejs.esm.min.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/build/littlejs.esm.min.js) - The engine exported as a minified module in release mode

To rebuild the engine you must first run ```npm install``` to setup the necessary npm dependencies. Then call ```npm run build``` to build the engine.

The starter project example also includes a batch file [build.bat](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/examples/starter/build.bat) that compresses everything into a tiny zip file using Google Closure, UglifyJS, Roadroller, and ECT.

## LittleJS Setup

To start LittleJS, you must create 5 functions and pass them to engineInit. A canvas will automatically be created and added to the document. 

```javascript
function gameInit()
{
    // called once after the engine starts up
    // setup the game
}

function gameUpdate()
{
    // called every frame at 60 frames per second
    // handle input and update the game state
}

function gameUpdatePost()
{
    // called after physics and objects are updated
    // setup camera and prepare for render
}

function gameRender()
{
    // called before objects are rendered
    // draw any background effects that appear behind objects
}

function gameRenderPost()
{
    // called after objects are rendered
    // draw effects or hud that appear above all objects
}

// Startup LittleJS Engine
engineInit(gameInit, gameUpdate, gameUpdatePost, gameRender, gameRenderPost, 'tiles.png');
```

## LittleJS Objects

Though not required, LittleJS is intended to be used as an object oriented system by extending the base class [EngineObject](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/src/engineObject.js) with your own. This lightweight class provides many useful features including physics, collision, parent/child system, and sorted rendering. Engine objects are automatically added to the global list of objects where they will be updated and rendered until destroyed. 

Here is a template you can use to make objects that behave however you want. See the examples for a complete demonstration.

```javascript
class MyObject extends EngineObject 
{
    constructor(pos, size, tileIndex, tileSize, angle)
    {
        super(pos, size, tileIndex, tileSize, angle);
    }

    update()
    {
        // update object physics and position
        super.update(); 
    }

    render()
    {
        // draw object as a sprite
        super.render();
    }
}
```

## Engine Source Code

This engine is made with simplicity in mind using clean easy to read code. There are only a few files used by the entire engine.

- [engine.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/src/engine.js) - Top level engine init, update, and render
- [engineSettings.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/src/engineSettings.js) - Global engine settings
- [engineObject.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/src/engineObject.js) - Base object class and physics
- [engineDraw.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/src/engineDraw.js) - Code for canvas drawing and text
- [engineAudio.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/src/engineAudio.js) - Spacial sound effects, and zzfx sound generator
