## How To Use LittleJS

To get started download the latest LittleJS package from GitHub or install via npm: ```npm install littlejsengine```

*You need to run a local web server to run LittleJS games during development!* You may see a console error like 'The image element contains cross-origin data.' Don't panic, it's easy to fix! If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) there is a [Live Preview Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) that will handle this for you automatically. Another option is to setup a simple local web server like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) via npm.

## Builds

To easily include LittleJS in your game, you can use one of the pre-built js files.

- [littlejs.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/dist/littlejs.js) - The full game engine with debug mode available
- [littlejs.release.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/dist/littlejs.release.js) - The engine optimized for release builds
- [littlejs.min.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/dist/littlejs.min.js) - The engine in release mode and minified
- [littlejs.esm.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/dist/littlejs.esm.js) - The engine exported as a module with debug mode available
- [littlejs.esm.min.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/dist/littlejs.esm.min.js) - The engine exported as a minified module in release mode

To rebuild the engine you must first run ```npm install``` to setup the necessary npm dependencies. Then call ```npm run build``` to build the engine.

The starter example project includes a node js file [build.js](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/examples/starter/build.js) that compresses everything into a tiny zip file using Google Closure, UglifyJS, and ECT Zip.
