## Getting Started
### What is LittleJS, and how is it different from other JavaScript game engines?

LittleJS is a lightweight, high-performance JavaScript game engine designed for simplicity and speed.
It offers a hybrid rendering system that combines the advantages of WebGL and 2D Canvas.
Unlike larger, feature-heavy engines, LittleJS focuses on 2D games and providing a comprehensive set of simple, easy to use features.
LittleJS is perfect for developers who want a minimal yet powerful engine to bring their 2D game ideas to life without the complexity of larger frameworks.

### How do I set up a basic LittleJS project?

Download the LittleJS repository via GitHub or npm.
Include one of the LittleJS builds from the dist folder.
Several examples are included for you to build on.
The most basic example is just an empty project.

[Empty Example HTML file:](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/examples/empty/index.html)
```html
<!DOCTYPE html><head>
<title>LittleJS Hello World Demo</title>
<meta charset=utf-8>
</head><body>

<script src=../../dist/littlejs.js></script>
<script src=game.js></script>
```

[Empty Example JavaScript file:](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/examples/empty/game.js)
```javascript
/*
    Little JS Hello World Demo
    - Just prints "Hello World!"
    - A good starting point for new projects
*/

'use strict';

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
function gameInit()
{
    // called once after the engine starts up
    // setup the game
}

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
function gameUpdate()
{
    // called every frame at 60 frames per second
    // handle input and update the game state
}

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
function gameUpdatePost()
{
    // called after physics and objects are updated
    // setup camera and prepare for render
}

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
function gameRender()
{
    // called before objects are rendered
    // draw any background effects that appear behind objects
}

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
function gameRenderPost()
{
    // called after objects are rendered
    // draw effects or hud that appear above all objects
    drawTextScreen('Hello World!', mainCanvasSize.scale(.5), 80);
}

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Startup LittleJS Engine
engineInit(gameInit, gameUpdate, gameUpdatePost, gameRender, gameRenderPost, ['tiles.png']);
```

### Why do I see a blank screen when I run my game?

If you are seeing a blank screen, first try opening the dev tools console (F12 in most browsers).
This will show you any errors that occur and allows stepping through code to help debug.
A common issue is the image data failing to load with a message like "The image element contains cross-origin data, and may not be loaded."
This is probably because the game was loaded directly without using a web server!

### Do I need a local server to run LittleJS games, and how do I set one up?

Yes, this is a necessary step because web browsers just have protection from loading local files which includes images.
So any JavaScript projects that load images like games must be opened from a local web server.
Don't panic though, it's very easy to fix! 

If you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) there is a [Live Preview Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) that will handle this for you automatically.

Another option is to setup a simple local web server like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) via npm.

### How does the camera and world coordinate systems work?

LittleJS drawing functions are all handled in world coordinates by default.
The conversion from world to screen is determined by the camera position and scale as well as the canvas size in pixels.
Camera scale determines how many screen pixels equals 1 world unit while the cameraPosition is the offset in world units.
There is also a function you can use called getCameraSize() to get the viewable camera window in world coordinates.

### Can I use LittleJS with build tools like Vite?

Yes, many people have set up projects using Vite and other build tools. [An example you can look at to get started is Michael Haynie shared their project for LittleJS Jam using Vite and several other tools!](https://github.com/michael-dean-haynie/littlejs-game-jam-2024)

### How do I load and add images to my game?

First you need to load an image file. For LittleJS this is typically done on startup via a parameter to engineInit that is a list of images to load. The engine will ensure that the images are all loaded before starting. Each source image can be up to 4096x4096 in size so most games only need one texture, though it's possible to load as many as you need.

```javascript
engineInit(gameInit, gameUpdate, gameUpdatePost, gameRender, gameRenderPost, ['tiles.png']);
```

LittleJS works best when your tile sheet is broken up into grids of tiles because the rendering system can be batched up. To draw a tile from a source image you can call drawTile and pass in TileInfo object. Another common approach is to create an EngineObject and set its tileInfo, it will automatically be rendered.

```javascript
drawTile(vec2(21,5), vec2(4.5), tile(3,128));
```

### What is the tile function and how do tile indexes work?

The tile function is a very useful function that takes a tile index and size and returns a TileInfo object which can be passed to functions like drawTile. It works by using the tileIndex multiplied by the tileSize to get the coordinates for the TileInfo. It's also possible to pass in padding for sheets that are set up for it.

### Can I add and switch between multiple sprites for a game object?

You can set the object's tileInfo to a new sprite, or just call drawTile directly with any sprite.

```javascript 
this.tileInfo = tile(3, 32);
```

### There are thin lines around my sprites sometimes, how can I fix that?

That is called tile bleeding, it happens when pixels from one tile blend into another neighboring tile. There are two approaches supported by LittleJS to fix the problem:
- Use tileFixBleedScale which shrinks tiles by a number of pixels. A very small value of around .1 or less can often fix the problem without noticeable issues.
- Create the sprite sheet with extra space around each tile. This can be done by adding a 1 pixel layer of padding around each sprite.

### How do I handle animations in LittleJS?

You can use the TileInfo.frame function passing in the number of animation frames to offset the sprite.
It sounds kind of weird at first but imagine your sprites are all aligned on a grid with frames of animations being next to eachother.
This allows easily indexing into those animations from the base sprite location.
For example to animate the player sprite you might do something like this...

```javascript 
this.tileInfo = spriteAtlas.player.frame(animationFrame);
```

### How can I fix thin rows of pixels bleeding in the sides of some sprites from neighboring tiles?

Pixel bleeding can occur when rendering tiles from a spritesheet due to sub-pixel inaccuracies or texture sampling issues. There are two effective ways to resolve this:

1. Use tileFixBleedScale, which works by shrinking all tiles slightly. Start by setting tileFixBleedScale to .5, this should eliminate the issue.

2. Add padding to the spritesheet by modifying it so each tile has 1 pixel of padding around it. Use the padding setting in the tile function to account for the padding when creating your tiles.

### How do I control the camera in LittleJS?

LittleJS uses a world space rendering system, so objects can move independently of the camera.
The camera is easy to control using cameraPosition and cameraScale, which indicate the world space position and how many pixels is equivalent to one world unit.
The default cameraScale is 32 while the default cameraPosition is just the origin.
It is also possible to draw using screen space pixel coordinates by passing in true as the screenSpace parameter to most drawing functions.

```javascript
setCameraPos(vec2(22,5)); // move camera to world position (20,5)
setCameraScale(20);  // zoom camera to 20 pixels per world unit
```

### How do I play sounds in LittleJS?

Sounds can either be generated on startup using ZzFX or loaded from a wave or mp3 file.
[ZzFX sounds can be created using the sound designer app.](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/)
Once loaded sounds can be played by calling Sound.play with some parameters to control how it is played.

```javascript
const sound_click = new Sound([1,.5]); // create a ZzFX sound
const sound_jump = new SoundWave('jump.mp3'); // load an mp3 sound
sound_click.play(pos, volume, pitch); // play a sound
```

### If I load several images, how do I control which is used?

There is just an optional parameter you can pass to the tile function or to TileInfo called textureIndex. It defaults to 0 so if you only have one texture, you may not have noticed it. If you set to another number will select another texture in list. Something to keep in mind for large games is that changing the target texture will require WebGL to flush the render batch which can cause slowdown if it is done many times per frame.

```javascript
function tile(pos=vec2(), size=tileSizeDefault, textureIndex=0, padding=0)
```

### How can I check if an object is on screen?

You can use the isOverlapping function to check the object against the camera. For culling you maybe want to enlarge the object size slightly to account for attached objects or rotation, I usually do this.size.scale(2).

```javascript
if (!isOverlapping(this.pos, this.size, cameraPos, renderWindowSize))
    return;
```

## Gameplay and Programming

### How do I add keyboard or mouse input to my game?

LittleJS provides input handling functions for keyboard, mouse, and gamepads. Touch input is also routed to the mouse. There are functions for isDown, wasPressed, and wasReleased. Input can only be checked during the update and should not be called from render functions.

```javascript
if (keyIsDown(37)) // Left arrow key
   obj.x -= 5;
if (mouseWasReleased(0)) // Left mouse button
   console.log('Mouse clicked at:', mousePos);
if (gamepadWasPressed(0)) // Gamepad button 0
   console.log('Gamepad pressed, stick is:', gamepadStick(0));
```

### How do I create and update game objects?

LittleJS can be used as an object oriented system by extending the base class [EngineObject](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/src/engineObject.js) with your own. This lightweight class provides many useful features including physics, collision, parent/child system, and sorted rendering. These objects are added to the global list of objects where they will automatically be updated and rendered until destroyed.

Here is a template you can use to make objects that behave however you want. See the examples for a complete demonstration.

```javascript
class MyObject extends EngineObject 
{
    constructor(pos, size, tileInfo)
    {
        super(pos, size, tileInfo);
        // setup object
    }

    update()
    {
        // update object physics and position
        super.update(); 
    }

    render()
    {
        // draw object as a sprite
        super.render();
    }
}

// spawn one of those objects
const object = new MyObject(pos, size, tileInfo);
```

### How can I load a 2D level map?

There are two parts that work together to make 2D level maps in LittleJS.
The tileCollision system is an array of values that correspond to each tile in the map.
The built in physics system can resolve collisions against this tile map very quickly.
For the visual side of things, there is a class called TileLayer which can be used in conjunction with tileCollision.
The TileLayer system works by pre-rendering the entire level to a texture so it can be drawn extremely fast each frame.
It is also possible to have multiple TileLayers for foreground and background layers.
[The platformer example shows a basic example of how to load data that was exported from an external editor.](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJS/examples/platformer/)

### Can I use physics with LittleJS?

Yes! LittleJS comes with a robust game physics system included and [also a plugin using Box2D.](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJS/examples/box2d/)
The platformer example includes a character object class that can be used as a starting point for advanced platforming physics.

### How do I add particle effects to my game?

[There is a particle system designer that is useful for experimenting with particle designs.](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJS/examples/particles/)

You can create a particle system in code using the ParticleEmitter object.

```javascript
// fire particle system
new ParticleEmitter(
    pos, 0,                         // pos, angle
    1, .1, 100, PI,                 // emitSize, emitTime, emitRate, emiteCone
    0,                              // tileInfo
    rgb(1,.5,.1), rgb(1,.1,.1),     // colorStartA, colorStartB
    rgb(1,.5,.1,0), rgb(1,.1,.1,0), // colorEndA, colorEndB
    .7, .8, .2, .2, .05,  // time, sizeStart, sizeEnd, speed, angleSpeed
    .9, 1, -.2, PI, .05,  // damp, angleDamp, gravity, particleCone, fade
    .5, 0, 1, 0, 1e9      // randomness, collide, additive, colorLinear, renderOrder
);
```

## Debugging and Development

### How do I debug my game in LittleJS?

In addition to your browser's built in developer mode, LittleJS has its own debug view.
Press the Esc key to show the debug menu. From here there are several options that can be accessed via the number keys.

You can also press + or - to adjust game speed to help with debugging, or just for fun!
